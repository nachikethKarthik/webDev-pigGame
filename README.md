This game was coded as a part of a set of udemy courses i did on frontend web development by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).The game is fairly simple, the user attempts to guess a number from 1-20 and the interface lets you know wether you are lesser or greater than the required number.You can also play again and try to beat your highscore.
